To use celery along with multiprocessing:
celery -A combolister worker --loglevel=info -P threads

To run redis server:
redis-server
If any error in redis server, then `sudo service redis-server stop` and rerun above

**dont forget to change number of valid combos & threads.
** modify the code to first get number of cores in processor and put threads equal to cores
